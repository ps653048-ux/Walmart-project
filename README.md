🛍️ Walmart Data Analysis Project (Python + SQL)

📌 Project Overview

This project is an end-to-end data analysis case study based on Walmart sales data. The objective is to transform raw data into an analysis-ready format and extract meaningful business insights through well-written SQL queries.

🗂️ Project Workflow & Methodology

Data Import & Exploration (Python)

1) Loaded raw Walmart sales data into Python for initial exploration.
2) Performed exploratory checks to understand data structure, data types, and quality issues.
3) Identified missing values, duplicates, and inconsistencies.
   
Data Cleaning & Preprocessing (Python)

1) Cleaned the dataset using Python libraries.
2) Handled missing and inconsistent records.
3) Standardized column names, formats, and data types to ensure smooth SQL ingestion.
4) Prepared a clean, structured dataset suitable for relational databases.
   
Data Upload to SQL

1) Exported the cleaned dataset from Python and uploaded it into a SQL database.
2) Created structured tables with appropriate data types.
3) Ensured data integrity and readiness for querying.
   
SQL Analysis & Query Writing
